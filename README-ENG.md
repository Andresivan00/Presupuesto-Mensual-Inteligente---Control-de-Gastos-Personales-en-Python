# **Smart Monthly Budget – Personal Expense Tracking in Python**

The most useful and beautiful program you'll have to **organize your money every month** and learn to truly save!

### **What this code does (and why it's amazing)**

It asks you in a super clear way:

* Your monthly salary
* Whether you live in your own home or a rented one
* How much you spend on: rent (if applicable), utilities, eating out, movies, going out…
* How much you **want** to save each month

And it instantly tells you:

* How much you spend in total
* How much you **really have left** to save
* Personalized advice with humor:

  * If you spend more on movies and going out than on electricity and internet → it says: *"you should go to the movies less"*
  * If you don’t reach your goal → it motivates you to eliminate small “hidden” expenses
  * If you achieve it → it congratulates you like a champion!
